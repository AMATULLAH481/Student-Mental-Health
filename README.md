This is a personal project I carried out to help practice my SQL skills, data visualization using Power BI and data reading skills.

* Data was obtained from Kaggle.
* I made use of Excel for the initial data analysis.
* Then I made use of SQL for the data exploration, investigation  and querying.
* I also made use of SQL for the mapping out of the data's KPI.
* For the visualization and storytelling, I made use of Power BI.
* I made use of filters to ensure interactivity and dynamic use.
* I created a total of 3 dashboards to ensure my insights were passed across efficiently.
